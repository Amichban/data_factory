# Project State

## Overview
Solo Software Factory - A comprehensive template for agent-augmented development workflows integrating Claude Code sub-agents, GitHub automation, and modern full-stack development practices.

## Current Status
- **Phase**: Development Setup
- **Stack**: FastAPI + Next.js + PostgreSQL + Redis
- **Deployment**: Docker Compose (local) + Railway (production)
- **CI/CD**: GitHub Actions
- **Agent Team**: PM, Architect, Backend, Frontend, Security, DBA

## Active Work
- [ ] No current active work items

## Completed Milestones
- [x] Project structure initialized
- [x] Claude Code configuration setup
- [x] Basic FastAPI and Next.js scaffolds
- [x] Docker Compose development environment
- [x] GitHub Actions CI pipeline

## Architecture Decisions
- FastAPI for API backend (performance, async support, auto-docs)
- Next.js 14 for frontend (React Server Components, performance)
- PostgreSQL for primary database (ACID compliance, complex queries)
- Redis for caching and sessions (performance)
- Railway for production hosting (simplicity, managed services)

## Technical Debt
- [ ] Add comprehensive test coverage
- [ ] Implement authentication and authorization
- [ ] Add monitoring and observability
- [ ] Set up proper error handling and logging

## Dependencies & Blockers
- None currently identified

## Metrics
- Tests: Not implemented yet
- Coverage: 0%
- Performance: Baseline not established
- Security: Basic pre-commit hooks in place

## Sign-off
- Architecture Sign-off issue: Not created
- Current ADR: ADR-0001 (Status: To be created)

## Next Steps
1. Create intent issue for first feature
2. Run /scope command to generate slices
3. Accept scope to create GitHub issues
4. Begin implementation with vertical slicing approach

## Risk Assessment
- **Low**: Well-established tech stack
- **Medium**: Solo developer capacity (bus factor = 1)
- **Mitigation**: Comprehensive documentation and automated workflows
