# Resistance Event Detection System - Project Scope

## High-Level Approach

The Resistance Event Detection System is designed as a comprehensive trading analytics platform that identifies resistance events (green-to-red candle transitions) across 29 financial instruments and 4 timeframes (H1, H4, D, W). The system architecture follows a vertical slicing approach with 10 interconnected slices delivering end-to-end functionality.

### Core Components:
1. **Data Layer**: Firestore-based storage for events, market data, and configurations
2. **Processing Engine**: Dual-mode processing (batch for historical, spike for real-time)
3. **Detection Algorithm**: Core resistance event identification logic
4. **API Layer**: RESTful services for data access and management
5. **User Interface**: Monitoring dashboard and event visualization
6. **Infrastructure**: Performance optimization and scaling capabilities

## Key Risks

### High Risk Items:
- **Market Data Ingestion Pipeline** (L): External API dependencies, rate limiting, and data quality
- **Batch Processing Engine** (L): Resource-intensive operations, concurrency management
- **Spike Detection System** (L): Real-time processing constraints, latency requirements
- **Performance Optimization** (L): Scaling challenges with high-frequency data

### Medium Risk Items:
- **Firestore Integration** (M): NoSQL design complexity
- **Resistance Detection Algorithm** (M): Algorithm accuracy and edge cases
- **Monitoring Dashboard** (M): Real-time data visualization complexity
- **Event Visualization** (M): Chart rendering performance with large datasets

### Risk Mitigation Strategies:
- Implement comprehensive monitoring and alerting
- Use feature flags for gradual rollout
- Establish performance baselines and SLAs
- Build robust error handling and circuit breakers

## Dependencies

### Critical Path:
1. Firestore Foundation → Market Data Ingestion → Resistance Algorithm
2. Algorithm → Batch Processing Engine → Event API
3. Algorithm → Spike Detection System → Event API
4. Event API → Monitoring Dashboard → Configuration Management
5. Event API → Event Visualization Interface
6. All previous → Performance Optimization

### External Dependencies:

## Feature Flags Strategy

Each slice implements feature flags for safe deployment:
- `firestore_enabled`: Database integration toggle
- `market_data_enabled`: Data ingestion control
- `resistance_detection_enabled`: Core algorithm toggle
- `batch_processing_enabled`: Historical processing
- `spike_detection_enabled`: Real-time processing
- `api_v1_enabled`: REST API access
- `monitoring_dashboard_enabled`: Admin interface
- `event_visualization_enabled`: User interface
- `admin_interface_enabled`: Configuration management
- `performance_monitoring`: Optimization features

## Rollback Procedures

Each slice includes specific rollback procedures:
1. Feature flag disable (immediate)
2. API version rollback (if applicable)
3. Database migration rollback (if schema changes)
4. Configuration reset to previous state
5. Service restart with previous container version

## Next Steps

1. **Accept Scope**: Run `/accept-scope` to create GitHub issues for each slice
2. **Team Assignment**: Assign slices to appropriate Claude Code agents
3. **Environment Setup**: Prepare development and staging environments
4. **Monitoring Setup**: Establish baseline metrics and alerting
5. **Security Review**: Conduct initial architecture security assessment

The project is ready for implementation with clear vertical slices, defined acceptance criteria, and comprehensive risk management strategy.
