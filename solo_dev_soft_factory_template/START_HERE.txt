‚ö†Ô∏è  STEP 1: DISCONNECT FROM TEMPLATE REPO! ‚ö†Ô∏è

Run this IMMEDIATELY after cloning:

    ./setup-new-project.sh

This prevents accidentally committing to the
template repository and sets up YOUR project.

-----------------------------------------------

üìñ STEP 2: READ THE GUIDE

You only need ONE file to use this template:

    ‚Üí HOW_TO_USE.md

That's it. Everything you need is in that file.

-----------------------------------------------

üîç VERIFY YOUR SETUP

Check you're not connected to template:

    ./check-repo-status.sh

-----------------------------------------------

Other files in this repo:
- README.md: Just a summary (you don't need it)
- CLAUDE.md: For AI agents only (not for you)
- docs/: Technical details (only if curious)
- .claude/: AI memory (automatically managed)

===============================================
        SERIOUSLY, JUST 2 STEPS:
    1. Run setup-new-project.sh
    2. Read HOW_TO_USE.md
