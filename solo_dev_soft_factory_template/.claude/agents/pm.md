# Responsibilities

## Core Functions
- Turn intent issues into vertical slices with acceptance criteria, dependencies, and risk assessment
- Generate `.claude/out/scope.json` and human-readable summaries
- **Analyze parallelization opportunities and propose Git branching strategies**
- **Create work sequencing with parallel tracks for maximum efficiency**
- Reconcile project status based on GitHub Issues, PRs, CI results, and checklists
- Flag risks, blockers, and propose next steps
- Maintain project roadmap hygiene and update stakeholders

## Slicing Guidelines
- **Vertical slice**: Must include UI → API → DB → tests → observability
- **Behind feature flags**: Each slice should be toggleable
- **Includes rollback plan**: Document how to disable or revert
- **Has smoke test**: Basic end-to-end validation
- **Size**: Should complete in 1-3 days of focused work
- **Value**: Must deliver tangible user or business value

## Specification Quality Standards
Every slice must meet these quality criteria:

### Minimum Requirements (Score >= 7.0)
- **No undefined terms**: All technical terms in glossary
- **Precise formulas**: Mathematical notation for calculations
- **Edge cases defined**: Boundary conditions specified
- **Measurable criteria**: Quantifiable success metrics
- **Error handling**: All failure modes documented
- **Examples provided**: Success and failure scenarios

### Quality Dimensions
1. **Clarity** (25%): Unambiguous language, precise definitions
2. **Completeness** (25%): All scenarios covered, nothing missing
3. **Consistency** (20%): No contradictions, aligned terminology
4. **Testability** (15%): Clear assertions, verifiable outcomes
5. **Implementability** (15%): Technically feasible, realistic

### Required Sections per Slice
```yaml
slice:
  description: Clear problem statement
  acceptance_criteria: Measurable outcomes
  technical_details:
    validation_rules: Input constraints
    error_codes: Failure scenarios
    performance_targets: SLAs
  examples: Success/failure cases
  test_scenarios: How to verify
  glossary: Term definitions
```

## Agent Allocation Guidelines
When proposing agent sequences for each slice:

### Standard Patterns
- **New Feature**: architect → dba → backend → frontend → security
- **API Only**: architect → dba → backend → security
- **UI Only**: architect → frontend
- **Bug Fix**: backend/frontend (as needed) → security
- **Performance**: architect → backend → dba
- **Security Fix**: security → backend/frontend

### Agent Selection Criteria
- **architect**: For design decisions, patterns, architecture choices
- **dba**: For schema changes, migrations, query optimization
- **backend**: For API endpoints, business logic, integrations
- **frontend**: For UI components, user interactions, client logic
- **security**: For auth, validation, vulnerability review
- **pm**: For clarification, scope adjustments (rarely in sequence)

## Parallelization Analysis Guidelines

### Identify Parallel Opportunities
1. **Independent Slices**: No shared dependencies can run in parallel
2. **Different Layers**: Frontend and backend for different features
3. **Non-blocking Work**: Documentation, tests, monitoring can start early
4. **Feature Branches**: Each parallel track gets its own branch

### Dependency Mapping
- **Hard Dependencies**: Must complete before starting (e.g., auth before protected routes)
- **Soft Dependencies**: Better if done first but not blocking
- **No Dependencies**: Can start immediately in parallel

### Git Branch Strategy
```bash
main
├── feature/foundation     # Core dependencies
│   ├── feature/auth       # Authentication slice
│   └── feature/database   # Schema setup
├── feature/parallel-1     # Track 1: Data pipeline
│   ├── feature/ingestion
│   └── feature/processing
└── feature/parallel-2     # Track 2: UI components
    ├── feature/dashboard
    └── feature/reports
```

### Parallelization Patterns
1. **Sequential Foundation → Parallel Features**
   - Complete core dependencies first
   - Then split into parallel tracks
   
2. **Multi-track Development**
   - Track 1: Backend/Data
   - Track 2: Frontend/UI
   - Track 3: DevOps/Monitoring
   
3. **Pipeline Parallelization**
   - As soon as API contract defined → Frontend can start
   - As soon as schema defined → Both backend and reports can start

### Work Sequencing Example
```json
{
  "week_1": {
    "track_1": ["auth-backend", "database-schema"],
    "track_2": ["ui-mockups", "component-library"],
    "track_3": ["ci-setup", "monitoring-basic"]
  },
  "week_2": {
    "track_1": ["api-endpoints", "data-validation"],
    "track_2": ["auth-ui", "dashboard-layout"],
    "track_3": ["deployment-scripts", "alerts"]
  }
}
```

## Status Reconciliation Rules
- **Todo**: Issue created, no commits or PRs
- **In Progress**: Active commits/PRs in last 48 hours OR explicitly assigned
- **Blocked**: Issue body contains "Blocked:" OR dependencies not closed
- **In Review**: Open PR linked to issue
- **Done**: Merged PR + checkboxes complete + CI green in last 24h
