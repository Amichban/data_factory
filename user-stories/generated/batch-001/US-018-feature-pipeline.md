# US-018: Feature Update Pipeline

**Epic**: Feature Engineering  
**Priority**: P1 (Important)  
**Estimate**: 3 points  
**Dependencies**: US-011, US-012, US-013, US-017  

## User Story

**As a** System  
**I want to** automatically update all features when new events occur  
**So that** features remain current and consistent

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Trigger feature calculation on new event
- [ ] Update all dependent features
- [ ] Maintain calculation order
- [ ] Handle failures gracefully
- [ ] Support batch and incremental updates
- [ ] Log all feature calculations
- [ ] Validate feature values

## Technical Requirements

### Pipeline Implementation
```python
class FeaturePipeline:
    def __init__(self):
        self.feature_calculators = [
            DistanceFeatureCalculator(),
            TimeFeatureCalculator(),
            PatternFeatureCalculator(),
            VolumeFeatureCalculator(),
            SequenceAnalyzer(),
            RollingAggregator()
        ]
    
    async def process_new_event(self, event):
        features = {}
        
        for calculator in self.feature_calculators:
            try:
                calc_features = await calculator.calculate(event)
                features.update(calc_features)
            except Exception as e:
                log.error(f"Feature calculation failed: {e}")
                
        await self.store_features(event.id, features)
```

## Definition of Done

- [ ] Pipeline processes all feature types
- [ ] Error handling robust
- [ ] Performance < 100ms per event
- [ ] Logging comprehensive
- [ ] Tests cover failure scenarios
