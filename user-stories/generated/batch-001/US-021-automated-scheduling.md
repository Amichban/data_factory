**Epic**: Operations & Quality  
**Priority**: P1 (Important)

## User Story

**As a** System Administrator  
**I want to** configure automated scheduling for all processing jobs  
**So that** the system runs without manual intervention

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Configure schedulers for each granularity

- [ ] Handle DST transitions correctly
- [ ] Implement job monitoring
- [ ] Alert on job failures
- [ ] Support job dependencies

## Technical Requirements

### Scheduler Setup
```yaml
jobs:
  spike_h1:
    schedule: "5 * * * *"
    command: "python -m processors.spike --granularity H1"
    timeout: 60
    retries: 3
    alert_on_failure: true
    
  spike_h4:
    schedule: "5 1,5,9,13,17,21 * * *"
    command: "python -m processors.spike --granularity H4"
    timeout: 60
    retries: 3
    
  daily_quality_check:
    schedule: "0 2 * * *"
    command: "python -m quality.daily_check"
    timeout: 300
    dependencies: ["spike_d"]
```
